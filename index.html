         <p>The Chakma people or Changhma people (Chakma:ëÑåëÑãëÑ¥ëÑüëÑ≥ëÑ¶), are an ethnic group from the eastern-most regions of the Indian subcontinent and Western Myanmar. They are the largest ethnic group of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of southeastern Bangladesh, and the largest in the Chakma Autonomous District Council of Mizoram, India. Significant Chakma
             populations are found in the northeast Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Assam.</p>
             <br>
             <p>The Chakma possess strong ethnic affinities to Tibeto-Burman groups in Northeast India. Because of a language shift in the past to consolidate power among the tribes, they adopted an Indo-Aryan language Chakma, which is closely related to the Chittagonian language, predominant near the areas in which they live.[5] Most modern Chakma people practice Theravada Buddhism, due to 19th-century reforms and institutionalisation by Queen regnant Rani Kalindi. In Myanmar, Chakma people are known as Daingnet and are one of the 135 officially
                 recognised ethnic groups there.[citation needed]</p>

                 <p>According to Pamela Gutman Chakma derives from the Sanskrit word ≈õaktimƒÅna, which means powerful and great.[8] The name was given to the Chakmas by one of the Burmese kings during the Bagan Era. Burmese kings hired Chakmas as ministers, advisers, and translators of Buddhist Pali texts. As employees of the king, the Chakmas wielded power in the Burmese court that was disproportionate to their number. The Burmese people still refer to Chakmas as Sak (·Äû·ÄÄ·Ä∫) or Thet, which 
                    are shortened and corrupted forms of ≈õaktimƒÅna.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The modern linguistic study suggests that the term "Chakma" originates from two constituent words: "Tsak" and "Ma". In this context, "Tsak" is believed to be derived from "Shak" which is associated with the Shakya clan, and "Ma" signifies "man" in Tibeto-Burmese languages.[9] The Chakma script shows similarities to Brahmi script suggesting 
                        Chakmas may descend from the Shakya lineage.[10]</p>

                        <p>Bijak of the Chakmas says that the Chakmas were part of Buddha's Sakya clan.[11] They gradually migrated to Arakan and extended their territory to the nearby hills of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.[12]

                            The Arakanese people referred to the Chakmas as Saks, Theks, or Thaikhs. In 1546 CE, while the Arakanese king Min Bin was fighting a battle with the Burmese, the Sak king attacked Northern Arakan Roma and occupied the Arakanese-controlled Chacomas of the Northern Arakan Mountains.[13]
                            
                            Diego de Astor created a map of Bengal, which was published as Descrip√ß√£o do Reino de Bengalla in the book Quarta decada da Asia (Fourth decade of Asia) by Jo√£o de Barros in 1615. The map shows an area named Chacomas on the eastern bank of the Karnaphuli River in what is now Chittagong Bangladesh,[14] suggesting that the
                             Chakmas inhabited this area during the time</p>
